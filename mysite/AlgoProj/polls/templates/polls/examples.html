    <p class="lead">Though this is not direclty related to computer science applications, one of my hobbies is to dance. When I am learning a new choreography, I often
      split the sections by 15 second increments, then I divide that by arm movements, then leg movements. From here, I divide further to pick up on the details, fine-tune the 
      details, then build back up, until the choreography is finished.

    <h2 class="featurette-heading">Greedy Algorithm/Dynamic Programming<span class="text-muted"> - In Sports!</span></h2>
    <p class="lead">Another hobby of mine is to indoor-rock climb. When I am met with a challenging problem, I first run through the sequence in my head, then I try out the 
      route by how I first read it. If I'm unable to get it in one go, then I look at the crux, and I consider the options that I have, which is similar to dynamic programming. 
      I try out that particular crux, and if there is one that I feel comfortable with, then I 'save that in memory', and do not consider the other options. The greedy choice my
      climbing algorithm makes is to look at the optimal climbing technique for that crux, and ignore the other possible techniques. Sometimes, you have to be as cost-effective
      even in climbing!
